                                restaurant called "The Place" and is ready to listen to requests and wishes of
                                various people coming to him. In return for the fulfillment of their requests,
                                he makes his own demands, which often sound terrible or sometimes directly
                                interfere with what he demanded from other visitors. While interviewing people,
                                the man always keeps a thick, leather-covered notebook at ready, reading from it
                                and writing the visitors' wishes with an expensive pen. Although the man
                                declares that he does not set impossible tasks, each of his demands implies
                                going against a number of basic ethical principles. The wishmaker also comments
                                that the people are free to cancel the deal anytime they want.

                                and desperately wants to find it again, is invited to get pregnant. Mechanic
                                Odoacre, in exchange for a night of sex with a model, is required to protect a
                                child. Gigi is asked to kill this little girl to save the life of a seriously
                                ill child. Old Marcella, in exchange for healing her husband's Alzheimer, must
                                perpetrate a massacre in a crowded place with an explosive device that she must
                                assemble herself. Young Martina has to commit a burglary for an exact value of
                                100,000 euros and 5 cents if she wants to become more beautiful. Blind Fulvio
                                wants to regain his sight and is assigned to rape a woman. Azzurra must break up

                                burglar whom police officer Ettore searches for, enters the deal with the man
                                without taking it seriously and asks for his father (Ettore) to leave him alone
                                forever.

                                Gradually, the lives of all the participants intertwines, sometimes making them
                                to help each other and other times to fight with each other. The ultimate goal
                                of the mysterious man, however, remains unknown until the cafÃ© waitress Angela
                                gets involved in the events, trying to understand the man's identity and
                                motivation. The film ends with an episode in which the man confesses to Angela
                                that he wants to stop doing what he does as he is very tired of his duty. Angela
                                says that this is possible, takes his notebook, pulls out a pen, and starts
                                writingâobviously assuming the man's role. In the last moments of the movie, the
                                same table is shown at which the man sat the entire film. However, now the table
                                is empty, and a page torn out from his notebook is burning in an ashtray as a
                                symbol of his completed mission.</p>

                                released worldwide in 2020 on Netflix and airing for free on BBC Four in the UK.

                                This is the second Icelandic series to be featured on Netflix, Trapped (ÃfÃ¦rÃ°) being the
                                first. The plot is loosely based on a real-life incident. As described in an article on
                                the website MEAWW, "In the late 1940s, an almost similar event took place in remote

                                14, where they were beaten and abused by the staff. Although in reality there was no
                                murder, per se, as shown in the series, it caused quite a noise and the boys were
                                eventually compensated in monetary terms.</p>

                                It contains several LGBT+ main characters, with plots that look at homophobia and
                                transphobia. Seen as satirizing the telenovela genre that it maintains elements of, it

                                genre has been described as a new creation, the "millennial telenovela", a label
                                supported by Caro and SuÃ¡rez.

                                The show was generally critically well-received, also winning several accolades. Cecilia
                                SuÃ¡rez and her character, Paulina de la Mora, have been particularly praised; described

                                Mexican pop icon, the character's voice has been the subject of popularity and
                                discussion, leading into its use for the show's marketing. Aspects of the show have been
                                compared to the work of Pedro AlmodÃ³var, and it has been analyzed by various scholars,
                                including Paul Julian Smith and Ramon Lobato.

                            <p>Successful advertising executive Howard Inlet becomes clinically depressed after his
                                young
                                daughter's death. He becomes a loner, rarely sleeping or eating, and at the office,
                                building
                                domino chains and structures.

                                Howard's estranged friends and business partners Whit Yardsham, Claire Wilson, and Simon
                                Scott fear for Howard's health and their company's future. His behavior has cost them
                                numerous high-profile clients and left them on the verge of bankruptcy. As the majority
                                shareholder, Howard blocks their efforts to sell the company.

                                The trio hires private investigator Sally Price to show Howard is unfit to run the
                                company,
                                hoping to take control. She intercepts three letters written by Howard which he posted
                                to
                                the abstract concepts of Love, Time, and Death, and presents them to the group.

                                Whit, Claire, and Simon hire three struggling actors â Amy, Raffi, and Brigitte â to
                                masquerade as the abstracts respectively to confront Howard about his letters. Sally
                                will
                                record these encounters and then digitally erase the actors to make Howard appear
                                mentally
                                unbalanced.

                                In preparation for their roles, Brigitte, Raffi, and Amy spend time with Simon, Claire,
                                and
                                Whit, who are undergoing their own personal problems: Simon is secretly battling cancer;
                                Whit is struggling to connect with his pre-teen daughter Allison after cheating on her
                                mother; and Claire is looking for sperm donors to conceive a child.

                                After encountering "Love", "Time" and "Death", Howard attends a grief support group
                                where
                                Madeleine befriends him, she has lost her own daughter, Olivia, to cancer; which led to
                                the
                                end of her marriage. She shows him a note from her husband, "If only we could be
                                strangers
                                again..." and continues enigmatically "And now we are." Howard also tells her about his
                                recent "conversations" with Death, Time, and Love. Madeleine tells him that on the day
                                Olivia died, an old woman at the hospital had told her to notice the Collateral Beauty,
                                which she has learned to recognize as acts of selfless kindness following tragedies.

                                As the group discusses the actors' performances, Amy storms out, feeling guilty about
                                manipulating Howard. Whit goes to convince her to return and declares romantic interest
                                in
                                her. She rejects him but agrees to commit to the plan if he makes amends with his
                                daughter.
                                Simon confides with Brigitte about his condition and his fear of death. She encourages
                                him
                                to share the burden with his loved ones.

                                "Love", "Time", and "Death" confront Howard again, but he lashes out at them,
                                particularly
                                Love, externalizing the pain he has held inside since the death. She tells him he owes
                                it to
                                his daughter's existence to love as he cannot live without it.

                                The next day, Howard attends a meeting with his company's board of directors in which
                                footage of the incidents, with the actors digitally removed, is shown. Howard realizes
                                his
                                mental state and behavior are ruining the company, so expresses his gratitude for
                                everything
                                his friends have done for him, promising to be there in their times of need. He then
                                signs
                                the documents given him to sell the agency.

                                Simon tells his wife about the cancer, who comforts him, although she already knew. When
                                Claire meets Raffi, he states she will make a good mother someday. She says time has
                                caught
                                up to her, to which he replies that her battle with time isn't over yet, and mentions
                                people
                                who had had a positive effect on his young life. Whit visits Allison at school who,
                                although
                                expressing anger and initially refusing to speak to him, he expresses his love for her
                                and
                                vows to return every day until she does. Allison reconsiders, and in parting, mentions
                                that
                                "tomorrow is a half day of school".

                                Howard visits Madeleine on Christmas Eve, who persuades him to watch a video of her
                                husband
                                playing with their daughter. Her husband turns out to be Howard playing dominoes with
                                their
                                daughter Olivia. He breaks down and finally says his daughter's name and cause of death,
                                and
                                hugs Madeleine. Brigitte is revealed to be the woman who had told Madeleine about
                                collateral
                                beauty.

                                Howard and Madeleine walk hand-in-hand through Central Park. He turns and sees Amy,
                                Raffi,
                                and Brigitte watching from a footbridge, but they vanish as Madeleine turns toward them.

                                major conspiracy.

                                Sigmund Freud (Robert Finster) is a 30-year-old neurologist fascinated by hypnotherapy,
                                discovered during a recent study trip to France in the well-known clinic of Dr.
                                Jean-Martin
                                Charcot, a fervent advocate of the psychic nature of hysteria. Despite the support of
                                his
                                mentor Josef Breuer (Merab Ninidze), Freud's innovative theories are met with rejection
                                by
                                Theodor Meynert, the director of the psychiatric hospital where he works, and by his
                                colleagues, including Leopold von SchÃ¶nfeld, Meynert's protÃ©gÃ©.

                                Sigmund is persuaded by his friend Arthur Schnitzler (Noah Saavedra) to participate in a
                                party organised by Countess Sophia von SzÃ¡pÃ¡ry (Anja Kling) under the pretext of
                                expanding
                                the circle of influential acquaintances. During the party, the countess together with
                                her
                                husband, Viktor von SzÃ¡pÃ¡ry (Philipp Hochmair), will stage a sÃ©ance revolving around the
                                figure of the Hungarian medium Fleur SalomÃ© (Ella Rumpf).

                                From that moment, Sigmund will find himself in the midst of murders, conspiracies,

                                and supernatural facts that he will have to solve by resorting to his new knowledge and
